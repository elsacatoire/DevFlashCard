1. Make sure you have the correct version of node.js and npm installed on your system.
Run this command to display the current version of npm :
```bash
npm --version
```
If you see a version number that's 8.5.0 or later, you're ready to create an Angular app. If you do not see such a version number, update node and try this step again before you continue.

2. Go to the project
Run this command to navigate to the new directory:
```bash
cd devFlashCard
```

3. Run the project
```bash
npm start
```

4. See in browser
http://localhost:4200
